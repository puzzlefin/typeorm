Made most of the functions throw MissingArgumentError so we don't
get the behavior of getting the last item if undefined/null sneak in.



Because of this:https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/5676

Connection.ts findMetadata has been patched

Add IF EXISTS to drop index and drop constraint in the migration queries

Sept 15, 2022

Removed IF EXISTS for constraints as that is valid
dropIndex got mogrified to deal with already removed indexii
Added ability to pass in a log4js to the migration executor

March 31 - This is for us to get the system only use milliseconds

Changed using NOW() to DEFAULT for updates/insert

Found a bug that is good thing it's like that. In 
the PostgresDriver.ts the makeTimeParts or whatever doesn't
have timestmaptz as it's case with the rest of the types, 
so it just falls through, which is actually what we want.

Also added the ability to pass in a string or function for timestamp
used for the soft delete instead of just using CURRENT_TIME using
softDeleteSetter

Addeded timestamptz3 type support


npm run compile
npm run package
